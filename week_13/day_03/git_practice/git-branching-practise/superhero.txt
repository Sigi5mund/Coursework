these are some words

Open the boxes, unpack what you own
Hang up some posters and make this a home
Walk down the stairs and open the door
Look at the things you've never seen before
This is the beginning, of anything you want
This is the beginning
This is the beginning, of anything you want
This is the beginning
Get on the buses, learn numbers and names
Your eyes are the camera, your heart is the frame
Hum a new song as you walk down the streets
Soon they'll be full with friends and memories
This is the beginning, of anything you want
This is the beginning
This is the beginning, of anything you want
This is the beginning
This is the beginning, of anything you want
This is the beginning
This is the beginning, of anything you want
This is the beginning
This is the beginning, of anything you want
This is the beginning
This is the beginning, of anything you want
This is the beginning

Once upon a time a superhero slept in.
She was tried of fixing the mess that the human beings kept making.
Her motivation was at an all time low.
Eventually she managed to drag herself out of bed.
But instead of saving the world she watched BoJack on Netflix and ate cake.
The end.
